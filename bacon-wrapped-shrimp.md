12 jumbo shrimp, 12-16 count per pound, peeled and deveined
12 slices thin bacon
kosher salt

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
If your shrimp are not deveined when you buy them, use kitchen shears to cut down the back of the shrimp (the top or longer side) and remove the shell. You can leave the tail on or off, your preference (I remove it). With a pairing knife, slice into the shrimp along the backside and remove the vein if you see one.
Also do not forget to remove the second vein along the bottom of the shrimp! You won't have to make a very deep cut there, just a slight score and you can scrape that smaller vein out. Note that if your shrimp did come deveined from the market, it will still have this smaller vein everytime so do remove it. Then rinse the shrimp under cold running water and pat dry with a paper towel.
Lay a slice of bacon out on your cutting board and start wrapping the tail end of the shrimp at the small end of the bacon. As you tightly wrap, overlap each layer of the bacon until you get to the end. If you get to the end of the shrimp when you're halfway through the bacon, you're wrapping it too wide, try again.
I like to sprinkle a tiny bit of kosher salt on each side, but that is my preference.
Heat a heavy bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. If you use a cast iron skillet, you won't need any oil as the shrimp will not stick, otherwise add just enough to coat the bottom. Sear the shrimp on each side for maybe 30 seconds and then finish them in the oven for about 6-8 minutes.
Eat them with a knife and fork and enjoy!
