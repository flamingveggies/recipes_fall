# recipes_fall

I copied and pasted a bunch of recipes into a repository and they are quite messy looking. Let’s make them all look nice! It’ll go quickly if we split up the load…

1. Split into groups of three people. Someone needs to fork my repository at https://github.com/flamingveggies/recipes_fall and add the other people in your group as collaberators.
2. Add the upstream repo as a remote so you can track changes from the upstream repo.
3. Pick two recipes for your group to fix up. Make sure the other groups know who is changing what!
4. These recipes are all in markdown files. Use the links https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics and https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet as for the syntax you’ll need to create nice formatted recipes.
5. Divide up your task and create a branch workflow. No committing to master!
6. Your formatted recipes should make use of lists, headings, etc in markdown.
7. Bonus points for “improving” recipes or adding images, super-fancy formatting, etc.
8. When you’re done, make sure all changes are merged into master. Create a pull request to send to changes to my upstream repo.

We’ll be doing this project today in class. If your group doesn’t finish, you’ll need to collaborate over Slack and/or Github issues. Remember you can also swing by office hours on Sunday. The final, passing pull requests are due next Tuesday.

NOTE: Make sure you git pull before you git push, git fetch upstream before you git merge, and retrieve the latest upstream changes BEFORE you PR.
